# Homework-Accessibility-assignment
The purpose of this exercise was to update and index with accessibility features

The fist update i made to the HTML was to include a "title" that was ommited from the original code. 

Next i thought it was important to include specific smantic HTML elements for screen readers ...base off some independent reasearch on youtube and google. 

So for example i used "nav", "article" , "section" , "aside" and "footer" to denote parts or section of the page. 

Also for the links / <a> in the Nav i included "title" within the "<a>" to add a hover over descriptor for each link in the nav. 

same  "title" i applied to the hero image. 

Also for the images i made sure to include the "alt" element and added a brief description to describe the picture.
